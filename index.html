        <em>Patrick Mahomes</em> has shattered the record books through his
        first 74 starts, but the most impressive number may be the 59-15 record.
        The .797 win percentage is already the highest in NFL history for any
        player who has made at least 75 starts.

        <em>Patrick Mahomes</em> is the second player to ever have 5,000 passing
        yards and 300 rushing yards in a season, and he is the only Q.B. other
        than Peyton Manning to throw for 5,000 yards and 40 TDs in two of the
        first three seasons.

        If <em>Mahomes</em> wins MVP, he'll be the 10th player in NFL history to
        win multiple MVP awards. Mahomes will be the third-youngest player at
        the time of their second MVP award and he would be the first player to
        win two MVPs and a Super Bowl MVP in his 20s (<em>Mahomes</em> just
        turned 27 in September).

        Here are just some of the records that <em>Patrick Mahomes</em> has
        smashed in his four years in the NFL. Became the youngest quarterback
        ever to be named Super Bowl MVP when the Kansas City Chiefs won Super
        Bowl LIV. At 25 years and 143 days, <em>Patrick Mahomes</em> became the
        youngest quarterback ever to appear in two Super Bowls when he played in
        Super Bowl LV. The previous record holder was Russell Wilson, who was 26
        years and 64 days old.

        He tied Kurt Warner at 17 300-plus-yard passing games in his first three
        NFL seasons.During the 2019 season, he threw for 1,831 yards without a
        single interception to begin the season. In the process,
        <em>Patrick Mahomes</em> snatched the record from Peyton Manning, who
        went 1,744 yards without an interception to begin an NFL season.

      <em>Patrick Mahomes</em> has redefined the quarterback position since he
      became the full-time starting quarterback for the Kansas City Chiefs in
      2018. Not only has <em>Mahomes</em> rewritten the record books, but the
      Chiefs have won a lot of games in the process. Kansas City has never
      missed an AFC Championship game in the four years <em>Mahomes</em> has
      started, winning two of them and capturing Super Bowl LIV. He already
      holds 11 NFL records in his five full seasons as starter.
